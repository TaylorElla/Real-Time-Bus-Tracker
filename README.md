# Real Time Bus Tracker
## Show stops between MIT and Harvard

<img src= "Real-time-bus-tracker.png" width='300'/>

Description of the project: This project showcases a map that can also track the bus stops between MIT and Harvard in real-time when the button is clicked. I styled my own map on Mapbox by changing the background color, adding icons across the city, adding color to the green areas and highlighing the educational buildings in yellow.

How to Run: Drag and drop the index.html file into your web browser. You can use the map as normal or click on the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to see the marker move from the bus stops between MIT until Harvard.

Roadmap of future improvements: I would like to change the marker to a different icon, maybe a bus.
